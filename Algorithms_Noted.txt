-----------------------------
SOLID:
- SRP: Single Responsibility Principle( One Class, One Purpose)
- OCP: Open/Closed Principle (Open for extend, Closed for Modify)
- LSP: Likov's Subtitution Principle ( Child Class subtitutable base class)
- Interface Segregation Principle (Separarate interface to small to avoid method child class don't need implement)
- Dependency Inversion Principle ( High-level(Core Bussiness Logic) soouldn't depend on low-level(Database, file IO, etc)

DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself):  reuseable code to avoid redundancy

KISS (keep it simple, stupid): 
- Solve problems using simple logic, 
- Use clear naming and structure, 
- Break complex code into smaller parts, 
- Only abstract if needed
