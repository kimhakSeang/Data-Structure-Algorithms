-----------------------------
SOLID:
- SRP: Single Responsibility Principle( One Class, One Purpose)
- OCP: Open/Closed Principle (Open for extend, Closed for Modify)
- LSP: Likov's Subtitution Principle ( Child Class subtitutable base class)
- Interface Segregation Principle (Separarate interface to small to avoid method child class don't need implement)
- Dependency Inversion Principle ( High-level(Core Bussiness Logic) soouldn't depend on low-level(Database, file IO, etc)

DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself):  reuseable code to avoid redundancy

KISS (keep it simple, stupid): 
- Solve problems using simple logic, 
- Use clear naming and structure, 
- Break complex code into smaller parts, 
- Only abstract if needed

AGILE Methodology: 
=> is project Management and Software Development approach that aims to be more effective.
=> is a way to manage the projects by breaking them into smaller parts.
=> is a mindset and methidology for developing products in small, iterative cycles with continues feedback and improvement.

- Agile normally have 6 stages:  
  1. Plainng
  2. Requirement Analysis
  3. Design
  4. Implement 
  5. Testing
  6. Deployment
